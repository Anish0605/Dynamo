Key Logic Steps:
1) Input Priority: The app listens for inputs in a specific hierarchy: Quick Action Buttons > Voice Input > Text Input.

2) Voice Processing: Audio is sent to Groq's Whisper-large-v3 model for near-instant transcription (0 latency).

3) Context Construction: * Document Mode: If a PDF is uploaded, the app extracts text using PyPDF2 and prioritises it in the system prompt.
   Web Mode: If no document is present, the app queries Tavily to fetch real-time sources (URLs, snippets) to ground the answer in fact.

4) Inference: The combined User Query + PDF Context + Web Results are fed into Llama 3 (via Groq) to generate a finalised, cited answer.
